WELCOME TO NAMANS PLAYLIST CREATOR 

Problems with the code:

1. Insert function inserts the song selected by rank as the first song of the playlist. (and not according to the position the user selects)
2. The create function doesnt limit the user to only 20 songs.

Things that can be improved

1. Trying to limit the user to only 20 songs
2. Making sure the insert function places the song in the right position.
3. The first song of every playlist created has weird numbers(maybe trying to ignore this in the program)
4. Making it more user friendly(like allowing them to edit more playlist at once... like as of now the user can work and edit playlist 1 and then it allows the user to work on a new playlist like playlist 2 but then doesnt let you go back to playlist 1 sometimes)
